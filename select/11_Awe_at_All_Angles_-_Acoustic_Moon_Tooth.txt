I am not adornments
Joined on new walls
I am torn muscle
I am budding bruise
The good pain
While the deeper hurt
Are these truths
I am not a bridge
No I am not two ends
Not two ends that meet to make one
I am white water
I am awe at all angles
Oh, I am not held hands
I'm not making plans
No, I'm not your man
I'm a goddamn conduit
Girl, I'm piss and vinegar
I am white water
I am awe at all angles
Awe at all angles
Courting over dinner
And a bottle of wine
I said You look real pretty
And your haircut's nice
For christ's sake
This is not living
It's killing time
My body's in the cage
But I'm in the sky
