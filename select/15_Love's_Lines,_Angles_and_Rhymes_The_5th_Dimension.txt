Love leads the lines of love in circles and angles
Love runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
(Running inside)
Cycles of fears with the longing and tears
Lettin' out the needs and laughter of
Sunshine... love shine
Touching the fibers of the feeling inside you
Lettin' out the things you hide oh-oh yeah...
M-m-m-m...
Need leads the lines of love in circles and angles
Need runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
(Running inside)
Cylinders of hope turning and yearning into pendulums of weary hesi... tation contemplation
Of the angles and rhymes and the triangle lines
The feeling touching mine with time
M-m-m-m...
Want leads the (want leads) lines of love in circles and angles
Want runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the angles and rhymes of the circles and lines
With the tunnels of love running over
Taking the mind and triangle rhyme and twisting it to fill the cup... of
Sunshine... love shine
Touching the fibers of the feeling inside you
Lettin' out the things you hide...
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
Cylinders of hope turning and yearning into pendulums of weary hesitation
Taken the fibers and leavin' in another heart and makin' all my love grow deeper
Angles and rhymes and the circles and lines
With the tunnels of love running over
Taking the line and triangle rhyme and twisting it to bend the mind in all directions
It's love and want and need and all those things
Tearing you apart
