I got problems in my face tho
Coming from all angles
Confusing me I'm tangled
Choking me I'm strangled
Left, right, up, down which way the train go?
Im the geek from the movie
That never know what to say, bro
If my grandad was here swear he know what to say
How do you tell if its real or its fake
How do you deal with the pain and the hate?
When the pain and the hate is spinning into shakes

When the pain and the ache is spinning into shakes
When the pain and the ache is spinning into shakes
If my grandad was here swear he'd know what to say (Yeah)
What would you do if you me were me for a day?

I been feeling like a burden
Always am I searching
Left, up, down, right
Never am I certain
When I look in the eyes why do people get nervous?
I keep trying and trying but nothing is working.
Front row funeral service.
To late nights filling my purpose
And Rest In Peace to J. Durdin
Cause you inspired my purpose

I got problems in my face tho
Coming from all angles
Confusing me I'm tangled
Choking me I'm strangled
Left, right, up, down which way the train go?
Im the geek from the movie
That never know what to say, bro
If my grandad was here swear he know what to say
How do you tell if its real or its fake
How do you deal with the pain and the hate?
When the pain and the hate is spinning into shakes
(Fuck)
When the pain and the ache is spinning into shakes
When the pain and the ache is spinning into shakes
When the pain and the ache is spinning into shakes
When the pain and the ache is spinning into shakes
Problems in my face tho
Coming from all angles
Left, right, up, down
Which way the train go
Im the geek from the movie that never know what to say bro
Grandad was here swear he
How do you tell if its
How do you deal with the
When the pain and the hate is spinning into shakes
