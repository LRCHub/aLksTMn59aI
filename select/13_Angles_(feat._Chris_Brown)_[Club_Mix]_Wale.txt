Oh, oh
($K, kick it fool)
(Hitmaka!)
Oh, oh
Yeah
(Sound)
(OG Parker)

See the way it's you and I, girl, I can't tame you (tame)
I can't blame you, yeah (blame)
You know the way to pose
You know, you know your angles, oh (straight)
I can't tame you, I can't tame you (tame) (yeah, Wale, yeah)
I can't, I can't change you, oh (ooh) (yeah)

Internationally known on this microphone
Holyfield, Ross crib, we at Tyson's though
Lonely nights, I'm alright, I can vibe alone
So don't tired if I'm quiet, no inquiring though
I know your angles, way back then bitches show your bracelets
Cartiers, stack 'em for days look like Thanos
You sayin' the universe ain't grateful (grateful)
I put infinity stones all on your fingers
Generous when I got feelings for who I got
Feelings for when I'm not, feeling you, girl, I'm not
Dealin' with other feelings, I feel that you feel alot
'Cause I be in my feelings, I'm givin' you what I've got
Maybe I'm on your page, maybe I got your heart
Maybe I can't love you 'cause I don't know where to start
Ain't chasin' your potential, potential ain't enough
I guess I am what I am, but you are who you was, what's up? (Wale)

See the way it's you and I, girl, I can't tame you (tame)
I can't blame you, yeah (blame)
You know the way to pose
You know, you know your angles, oh (straight)
I can't tame you, I can't tame you (tame) (you look good, girl)
I can't, I can't change you, oh (ooh) (said you look good)

Okay, this energy's givin' me sex symbol
Pose for me, girl, I think I'm the best with you
Pose for me more, I think you're the best for me
Now post when I'm done, then credit your ex-nigga
Hey, you petty, you flex different
You know I be the plug, the one that connect with you
Now go up in these stores and tell 'em who mess with you
You know I'd take you home, but now you address different (woo)
I ain't trickin', we clickin' and I ain't trippin'
You sippin' reposado, come sit while I say my sentences
I be with Hood, Chris and 'em, or the slimes
It's Young Folarin, I've been poppin' back when poppa came out (Ooh)
I be like, "Shorty, shorty, put that shit on and take a pic, I bet

You catch a body"
Six-hundred-fifty, I pull up, they gon' wan' eighty to us
They gon' be hatin' on us
But you be straight, then I be straight, and ain't no angle to it
Let's do it, woo ayy Chris

See the way it's you and I, girl, I can't tame you (tame)
I can't blame you, yeah (blame)
You know the way to pose
You know, you know your angles, oh (straight)
I can't tame you, I can't tame you (tame)
I can't, I can't change you, oh (ooh)
