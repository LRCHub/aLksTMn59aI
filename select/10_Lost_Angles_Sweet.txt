Infinity
Like time without a friend who'll sing the song
If melodie should end you're dead my friend

Lost angels come and take control
Lost angels gotta keep on hold on
Hold on, hold on

Gotta get on back to the life in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my feet
Gotta get back to the love in the street
We're lost angels
Gotta choose the way to rock' n' roll

Insanity
I can feel the knives inside my brain
I stand alone at the threshold of my pain

Lost angels come and take control
Lost angels gotta keep on hold on
Hold on, hold on

Gotta get on back to the life in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my feet
Gotta get back to the love in the street
We're lost angels
Gotta choose the way

I see it now
All my friends inside my life appeared before my eyes
And returning to space to see myself dissapear

Lost angels come and take control
Lost angels gotta keep on hold on
Hold on, hold on

Gotta get on back to the life in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my feet
Gotta get back to the love in the street
We're lost angels
Gotta choose the way
Gotta get on back to the life in the street
Gotta get down 'cause I'm dead on my feet
Gotta get back to the love in the street
We're lost angels...
